Theory part: This is the theoretical background.
What is Bootstrap?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)
No need to document anything related to the theory part – you can if you want to – if that is the way you learn best and you gain your understanding.
Practical part, use the same numbering in your document:
